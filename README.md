## Goal of project
Breast cancer detection and Interpretability of Deep Learning models are the goals of this project. With screening mammograms gathered from routine screening, you'll train your model.

Our efforts to enhance screening mammography detection automation may help radiologists provide better patient care by enhancing their accuracy and efficiency. Additionally, it might aid in lowering expenses and pointless medical procedures.
## Dataset
* The mammograms images are in dicom format.
* There are total 11,913 patients/folder in train set and roughly 8,000 patients in hidden test set.
* They have also provided a csv file which contains a metadata of each image/slice.
* There are usually but not always 4 images per patient.

For this project we used the converted to PNG (512px) format images as a dataset beacuse we here we are more focused on interpretability You can also find the same in the link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/radek1/rsna-mammography-images-as-pngs
